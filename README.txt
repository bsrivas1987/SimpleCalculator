Hi,

I have coded for a simple calculator using Python programming language and HTML. This program takes input from the user and does a simple calculation depending on the calculation type chosen by the user. It changes the display according to the data input from the user. The project includes the python file name app.py and the html file DataEntry.html. I have used pyCharm software and flask framework to develop this code. As I have mostly worked in Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence area, my exposure to the development of Web API is limited, but I have tried my best to learn the python and HTML in last week and tried to write this code. I couldnot successfully implement the history of the log of all the calculations. But I will keep working on it to get it done.
I have uploaded the files on my Github account "bsrivas1987" and made it public.

Thank you,
Bhavana
